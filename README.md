# On-Prem Email Server

A modern on-premise open source email server.

## Project Goals

1. On-premise, cloud-managed
2. Operator-less storage and live snapshots
3. Effortless migration

## Docs

* [Project goals](./docs/Goals.md) (elaborated)
* What about [SpamAssassin?](./docs/SpamAssassin.md)
* What about [Roundcube?](./docs/Roundcube.md)

## Building

```sh
$ make
```

### After changing a model or proto file

```sh
$ make generate
$ make
```

## Testing

```sh
$ make check
```

## Running

```sh
$ make
$ cd $GOPATH/bin
$ ./on-prem-emaild
2019/09/22 02:05:25 INFO Opened database /.../on-prem-emaild.db
2019/09/22 02:05:25 DEBUG Ensuring indexes
2019/09/22 02:05:25 INFO Listening for IMAP4rev1 on :8143
2019/09/22 02:05:25 DEBUG Connected to wss://api.on-prem.net/v1/agentStream
2019/09/22 02:05:25 INFO On-Prem Email Server started
2019/09/22 02:05:25 INFO Node id is bm3jict5jj84bcnaud40
```

Then visit the Admin Portal at [https://console.on-prem.net](https://console.on-prem.net).

## Running with a local Admin Portal

Begin by cloning, building, and running the [On-Prem Admin Portal API Server](git@github.com:Megalithic-LLC/on-prem-admin-api.git):

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Megalithic-LLC/on-prem-admin-api.git
...
$ make
$ cd $GOPATH/bin
$ ./on-prem-admin-api
2019/09/22 01:56:10 INFO Attached to MySQL
2019/09/22 01:56:10 INFO Completed migrations
2019/09/22 01:56:10 INFO Attached to Redis at localhost:6379
2019/09/22 01:56:10 INFO Listening for http on port 3000
2019/09/22 01:56:10 INFO On-Prem Admin API started
```

Then start the email server in this project with:

```sh
$ make
$ cd $GOPATH/bin
$ ./on-prem-emaild
2019/09/22 02:05:25 INFO Opened database /.../on-prem-emaild.db
2019/09/22 02:05:25 DEBUG Ensuring indexes
2019/09/22 02:05:25 INFO Listening for IMAP4rev1 on :8143
2019/09/22 02:05:25 DEBUG Connected to ws://localhost:3000/v1/agentStream
2019/09/22 02:05:25 INFO On-Prem Email Server started
2019/09/22 02:05:25 INFO Node id is bm3jict5jj84bcnaud40
```

Finally, clone and run the [On-Prem Admin Portal UI](git@github.com:Megalithic-LLC/on-prem-admin-ui.git), and login:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Megalithic-LLC/on-prem-admin-ui.git
$ cd on-prem-admin-ui
$ npm install
$ ember serve --proxy=http://localhost:3000
Proxying to http://localhost:3000

```

## Using Admin Portal

![Admin Portal :: Login](./docs/login.png)

After logging in with the default credentials of `admin` and `password`, you'll be prompted to the effect that you haven't registered any agents yet. 

![Admin Portal :: No Agents](./docs/no-agents.png)

Claim the running emaild agent by finding its node id in its startup log, and entering it into the admin ui:

![Admin Portal :: Claim Agent](./docs/claim.png)

Finally, once the agent is selected, go to the marketplace, find the email service offering, select the free plan, and launch it to create a service instance and site configuration for your agent.

## Design

### Storage

The [BoltDB](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) and [BadgerDB](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) storage engines are supported, with BoltDB currently being the hard-coded default. [Genji](https://github.com/asdine/genji) is used as a layer above the storage engines to manage secondary indexes, and provides a data access interface.

### Configuration and connection to Admin Portal

The email server is configuration-free (no local config files, no local operator interface), and obtains its configuration updates from the Administration Portal API Server. A Websocket connection is maintained, and protobuf messages are exchanged using a request-response handshake involving request id's.
